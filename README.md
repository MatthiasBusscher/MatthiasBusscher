# Hi, I'm Matthias 👋

Curious, eager to learn, problem-solver who likes using data and automation to make work easier and smarter.

## What I'm learning

- **SQL & Python** for data analysis and automation scripts  
- **Google Sheets + Apps Script** for dashboards and workflows  
- **Make.com / Zapier** for no-code integrations  
- **Git, Docker & CI/CD** as my first DevOps tools  
- Prompt engineering and **AI‑assisted development**

## Projects

- **Sales Analysis with SQL**  
  Exploratory analysis of a retail sales dataset in SQLite.  
  SQL scripts answer questions about total revenue, regions, products, monthly trends, customer types, channels and payment methods.

More projects will appear here as I keep learning.

Most of this profile is practice code and experiments as I improve step by step. If you have suggestions or ideas for what I should build next, I’d be happy to hear them.
